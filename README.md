An Comparative Analysis of Various Supervised Classification Algorithms for Predicting Diabetes Disease.
In the context of this research, we investigate how ML algorithms and DM techniques perform when used with particular datasets. Then, using data from Diabetes datasets, We assess the effectiveness of machine learning classifiers by evaluating their accuracy, precision, recall, and the F-measure. Our goal is to clarify which data analysis methods (Supervised Classification Methods) are most successful. The findings of our study highlight the significance of carefully choosing the right classifier when working with historical data in order to produce results that are useful for prediction and well-informed decision-making in the future.
